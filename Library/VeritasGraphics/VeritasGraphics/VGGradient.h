/* A VGGradient defines a transition between colors. The transition is
 defined over a range from 0 to 1 inclusive. A gradient specifies a color
 at location 0, one at location 1, and possibly additional colors assigned
 to locations between 0 and 1.
 
 A VGGradient has a color space. When a gradient is created, all colors
 specified are converted to that color space, and interpolation of colors
 occurs using the components of that color space. See the documentation of
 each creation function for more details. */

 `components' with locations provided in `locations'. If `locations' is
 NULL, the first color in `colors' will be at location 0, the last color
 in `colors' will be at location 1, and intervening colors will be at
 equal intervals in between. Otherwise, each location in `locations'
 should be a VGFloat between 0 and 1. Each set of color components should
 specify a color in the color space `space' (which may not be a pattern or
 indexed color space). The number of locations is specified by `count';
 the number of color components is the product of `count' and the number
 of color components of `space'. If no color is provided for 0 or 1, the
 gradient will use the color provided at the locations closest to 0 and 1
 for those values. */
